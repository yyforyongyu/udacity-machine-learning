    "Bitcoin has became one of the hottest topic in main stream slowly ever since [silk road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace) was shut down by FBI. If you haven't heard of it, [you can check it here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin). In short, you can think Bitcoin as a distributed currency system, although it is behaving more like an investment today as more and more people are trading instead of using them. It was 2013 when I first heard about Bitcoin, and ever since then I became an enthusiast about its future. I also bought my first Bitcoin when I first heard about it, and started my trading bitcoins ever since. After studying about machine learning, I think it would be interesting to apply it into trading bitcoin, and see if I could beat the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2014, [a group of researchers from MIT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.1231v1.pdf) claimed that they doubled their bitcoin investment using a Bayseian regression model. Same year, [researchers from Stanford](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2014/Isaac%20Madan,%20Shaurya%20Saluja,%20Aojia%20Zhao,Automated%20Bitcoin%20Trading%20via%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms.pdf) \n",

    "To solve this problem, one should identify it as a supervised learning problem. When we say we want to do time series prediction, we need to precisely define the range of time we want to predict. Here, our goal is that as data coming in every minute, the model could predict the price change for the next 10, 30, and 60 minutes. So this would be an online, real time model used to predict the price of bitcoin.\n",

    "Although there were only two researches found for this particular topic, the general price prediction is a wide field that has a lot research papers. Particularly, for stock price prediction, ideas like strength index could be used here too. However, a lot of the techniques and indexes found in stock price prediction won't be used here due to the lacking of theorical prove, or the increasing complexity of the model. This can be saved for future explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go and get some real data, the next thing is to pick out a few algorithms which have been used in research before. We will apply a set of chosen algorithms, compare their performance based on accurary score, and find out the best one. Based on the research, the models chosen are generalized linear model, support vector machine, random forest and recurrent neural network.\n",

However, since it is a rule of thumb that we always check and clean the data we got, we some basic rules to validate and preprocess our dataset. For the dataset, we can make API calls to Coinbase and get a half year's trading records, recorded every second. Although this dataset is of the higher quality data you can find on the interest, the following process will be applied,\n",
    "+ validate each field, make sure they have the right type. For example, all the price fields should be float or digit, the amount field should be int, and the datetime should be using IOS format;\n",
    "+ it is expected that not every second would have a corresponding record, that is why we want to use each minute to predict the price movement, not every second. To do this, it would need us to combine the data into a subset using one-minute window. If, for example, the platform was down for a given time period, we would smooth the blanks by averaging the begining and ending prices of the blanks.\n",
